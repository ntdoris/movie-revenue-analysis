    "# Project Proposal\n",

    "# Question 1: When doing your analysis, what measurement will you use to determine the success of a movie? \n",
    "# (e.g.: rating, return on investment, worldwide gross)\n",
    "\n",
    "#I'd like to focus primarily on profit margin & return on investment to help Microsoft determine the most efficient use of its capital in investing in the movie business. I would also like to compare reviews to profitability to see what kind of relationship exists between the two variables / whether that can inform how they strategize which genres or types of movies they focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "# I would like to focus on return on investment, first, rating second\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2: What are some aspects of a movie you could investigate? (e.g.: Genres, Release time, \n",
    "# Director/Actors, Budget)\n",
    "\n",
    "#I would like to investigate genre as well as total number of genres per movie, both by profitability & average review. I'd also like to investigate seasonality - what is the best time of year to release? Have there been any trends over the years with regards to worldwide revenues and profits? Other factors I would like to look at are run time (is there an ideal movie length?), language, directors (ranked by success in terms of total gross and profitability), and domestic versus foreign revenue. I'd also like to take a look at the most successful studios to understand their average budget size, market focus, most common genre, etc.\n",

    "# Most successful genre / combo of genres? both by profit and average review (only look at reviews with min number of votes)\n",

    "# runtime - can a movie be too long?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Number of movies per year per studio - more movies at low budget or less movies at higher budget?\n",
    "# average budget size per studio, profit margin higher in low budget or high budget movies?\n",

    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "# Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. \n",
    "# They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You \n",
    "# are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must \n",
    "# then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio \n",
